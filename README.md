# NumLang
A basic number-handling memory-based programming language using an interpreter written in Python. 

## What is NumLang?
NumLang (Number Language) is just a small test in Python. It has a small command set, but, in theory, it should be possible to replicate almost any processing algorithm on Earth, be it rather impracticle to do so.

## Uses
NumLang is great for education and teaching students about Assembly Language in a human-readable format. Due to its Python-based interpreter, it is cross-platform and even web compatible.

## Try it
To try out the basic language, there's a Repl.it link to an online version of the language:

Be aware that this web build is very limited and misses the constructs like 'Jump' and 'Module' which make some algorithms and loops possible. For this functionality you have to write NumLang script.
